Hello! This is my first project using React and Node.js.

It is a URL Shortener that I am not hosting although I totally could. Hosting fees are a tad more than what I want to spend currently. 

Here is an example of what you are greeted with when launching the website.

What's neat about this website is that the background image is dependent on the size of your window meaning that if you change your window size, the background image changes too! (Terrible crop but I really liked the background image!)

To use it, simply put in a link that you want to be shortened. The new and improved link will show up underneath, and clicking in it will take you there!

What's next: I really want to beef this up a bit. I want to try to:
- [ ] Round out the UI to make it feel more modern
- [ ] A better opening -- looks too plain right now
- [ ] Add site preview like what goo.gl had back in the day
- [ ] Add functionality to create custom slugs for links
